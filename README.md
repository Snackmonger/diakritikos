Diacritic Helper
----------------

I am too lazy to remember even the basic codes for unicode characters with
diacritics, so I threw this program together to help me write special
symbols easier.

Some letters can accept multiple diacritics, but most not. Sometimes a 
diacritic is only found on one letter, so it might piggyback off of another
symbol if it doesn't conflict. In general, the symbols are:

```
    /   Acute accent
    '   Double acute accent
    \   Grave accent
    `   Double grave accent
    ~   Curly circumflex / tilde
    ^   Pointy circumflex
    $   Caron
    _   Macron
    -   Breve
    @   Dot under letter
    \*   Dot over letter
    |   Line through letter, or ligature
    ]   Left-facing hook/cedilla
    [   Right-facing hook/cedilla
    &   Underline
    %   Circle above
    #   Right side horn
    +   Diaresis/Umlaut
    !   Special phonological symbol
```
